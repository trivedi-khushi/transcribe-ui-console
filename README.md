# Transcribe UI Tool 🎧📝

A clean and minimal **Next.js-based frontend** for uploading `.wav` audio files and displaying AI-generated transcriptions. Designed to be fast, extendable, and developer-friendly.

This tool acts as a **UI layer** for any speech-to-text backend (e.g., OpenAI Whisper) — enabling users to submit audio files and receive readable, timestamped transcripts in seconds.
